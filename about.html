				<h1>Retired Clarkstown Resident Starts Salad Dressing Company</h1>
				<p>Pop Pop's Best is available so far in Congers, Nyack, Pearl River and New City stores.
                When he retired a bit less than two years ago, Lee Licht wasn’t sure if he wanted to kick back and relax. 

Instead, he started a business. 

“I was urged by my family to come out and market a salad dressing that I had been making for them and for my friends for years,” he said. “So, basically, that’s what I did.” <a href="http://pop-pops-best.com/News.html">Read more</a>

                For years my family and friends have enjoyed my homemade salad dressings, dips and marinades.  They urged me to market my creations for everyone’s enjoyment.  I’ve created POP-POP’S BEST for exactly this purpose.

Now you can enjoy POP-POP’S BEST in your own home!

My NEW Balsamic Gourmet Vinaigrette will dazzle your taste buds with a unique combination of flavors, sweetness and a little zing.  This amazing Balsamic dressing easily doubles as a fine marinade for meats and vegetables.

Enjoy it and please use the Guest Book to tell your story and let others know how you liked it!
